Add a `defaults` block to `~/.agentproto/config.json` — global and per-adapter `skills`/`options` auto-applied to every `agent_start` spawn. A normalized `skills: string[]` is folded into the resolved adapter's native option shape (e.g. hermes' comma-joined `--skills a,b`); adapters with no declared `skills` option are a no-op.
