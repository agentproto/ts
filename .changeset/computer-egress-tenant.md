`computer` sandbox provider: forward a configurable `egress` allowlist on create (the controller denies all egress, DNS included, without one), and add an optional `tenantId` setup field that fills `COMPUTER_TENANT_ID` from the stored provider profile.

Boot now works for the unprivileged guest user: the CLI installs under `~/.local` (global `/usr/local` is root-owned), the daemon log moves from `/var/log` (not writable) to `~/.agentproto-daemon.log`, and a non-zero exit from the CLI install or a setup command fails the boot with the step's output instead of timing out on health.
