Implement AIP-41 routine runtime bridge: tight schema for `target` union (tool/agent/workflow/action), `RoutineRegistrar` that reads `.routines/*/ROUTINE.md` and registers cron jobs, `dispatchTool` gateway for in-process MCP tool calls, HTTP `/routine-defs/:id/trigger` and MCP `routine_trigger` tool (mirrors `cron_run`). New `TargetAgent` sugar kind for agent spawning (ahead of upstream draft). Comprehensive unit + integration tests proving all three target kinds fire through real dispatch mechanism.
