Implement restart-scheduler (PR-2 of crash-detect chantier): opt-in automatic restart for agent sessions that crash unexpectedly. Introduces RestartPolicy per-session configuration with exponential backoff and rolling-window crash-loop cap. Event-driven scheduling evaluates policy on session:exited; periodic sweep executes due restarts via in-place resume. Persists state so daemon restart mid-backoff preserves schedule. Includes comprehensive test suite and proper lifecycle integration.
