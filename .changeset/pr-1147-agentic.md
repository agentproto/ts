Implement port exposure for sandboxes. Add `expose(port)` method and `ports` map to `BootedSandbox` to enable agents to expose HTTP server ports inside sandboxes as publicly accessible URLs. Support pre-declaring ports via `extraPorts` in the sandbox spec for eager resolution at boot time. E2B provider implements port exposure via `sandbox.getHost(port)`. Surface exposed ports in `SessionDescriptor` and `SessionSummary` via new `sandboxPorts` field.
