Claude subscription on pi/opencode/mastracode — each through the door that actually exists — and honest subscription eligibility everywhere. The runtime assumed "Anthropic OATs work as API keys" for every model-derived adapter and silently injected the subscription OAuth token into `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, where Anthropic's edge rejects it as an invalid key after the session is live (observed on opencode: "Internal error: API key is invalid"). Subscription support now requires an explicit, provider-matching `authSubscription` surface, shared across all four eligibility/resolution sites via one `subscriptionAppliesTo` predicate. pi declares its documented bearer env (`ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN`, scoped `provider: "anthropic"`) so a Claude subscription profile runs pi's anthropic models natively. opencode and mastracode declare `external` anthropic-scoped subscriptions — each CLI's OWN Claude Pro/Max OAuth login (`opencode auth login`; mastracode's `/login`), backed by new `opencode`/`mastracode` provision recipes pointing at each CLI's auth store: the runtime verifies the login is present (fail-loud), injects nothing, and scrubs the api-key vars so a leftover key can't override it. Adapters/models with no matching surface fail fast at spawn with an actionable message instead of failing opaquely upstream, and the catalog stops advertising subscription profiles as runnable on them.
