AIP-15 P2: `harness.knowledge[]` on `kind: "agent"` steps. A selector pins an AIP-10 corpus workspace (relative paths resolve against the WORKFLOW.md dir at load time; a missing workspace fails the load), `anyOf`/`allOf` tag filters, refined `kinds`, a `maxEntries` cap (default 50, slug-ascending deterministic order) and v1 `mode: "files"`. Before an agent step's spawn, the runtime resolves each selector with the corpus `resolveKnowledge`, writes the matched raw entries to `<stepCwd>/.knowledge/<workspaceBasename>/<slug>.md` plus a deterministic `INDEX.md`, prepends a prompt note pointing at the index, and records `knowledgeApplied: { workspace, matched, written }[]` on the step's run record. An empty match is not an error — it is recorded and emitted as a `session:harness-warning` (`knowledge-empty`). `resolveKnowledge`'s signature is unchanged; the new `filterEntriesByAllOf` helper beside it provides the AND-semantics post-filter.
