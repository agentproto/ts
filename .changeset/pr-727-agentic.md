Curate OpenAI gpt-5.6 series (luna, sol) into claude-code and claude-sdk with `@openrouter` suffix, allowing Anthropic-native adapters to spawn these models via OpenRouter gateway. Refine auth-engagement logic to detect resolver-coupled gateway routes via `baseUrl` field in `ResolvedAuthSpec`, ensuring credentials are injected for runtime-resolved routes while protecting against native-credential leaks on manually-configured base_urls. Add comprehensive P0 test validating credential injection, base_url preservation, and scrubbing of conflicting provider vars.
