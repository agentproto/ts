# @agentproto/office

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f4047da: Follow AIP-22 "An office spans a company tree". The frontmatter schema is regenerated from the vendored `OFFICE.schema.json`: `extends` now names an `OFFICE.md` (`../OFFICE.md` from a child node; it demanded `COMPANY.md` before, so no view could parse), `executor` also accepts the AIP-54 compact `operator:<slug>[@<owner>/<slug>]` form, and `work` is tightened to the AIP-54 `ws://workspaces/@<owner>/<slug>/WORK.md` ref. The old `ws://workspaces/<slug>` form `work` accepted was never spec-compliant, so manifests still using it must move to the AIP-54 ref. New `analyzeOfficeTree` checks what the schema cannot: one workspace-root office per tree (`office_tree_second_root`), views whose `extends` stays in the tree, seats whose containment `parent` is an allowed item or a `workspace:` view of the same tree under the reserved kind `view` (`office_seat_parent_outside`, per item), `reportsTo` resolving inside the office and honoring `reporting.cardinality` (`office_reports_to_cardinality`), holders as `operator:`/`user:` compact refs or `ws://operators/<slug>` (`office_holder_unresolvable` warning), the node of a seat, and the executor lens of a node. `readOfficeTree` (in `@agentproto/office/manifest`) loads the input from a folder.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d3dd524: Align `SPEC_NAME` with the canonical AIP-70 names registry, add the `defineAuth` alias for `defineAuthProvider`, and point the runtime approval request at the accepted AIP-7.

### Patch Changes

- 5ab8114: Switch the workspace dependents of the deprecated `@agentproto/define-doctype` shim to the canonical `@agentproto/doctype` package. Update dependency keys, import specifiers, tsup externals, and generated scaffolds; keep the shim and changelogs untouched.
- 5ab8114: Switch the workspace dependents of the deprecated `@agentproto/define-doctype` shim to the canonical `@agentproto/doctype` package: dependency keys, import specifiers, tsup externals, the lockfile, and the generated AIP scaffold. The shim itself and per-package changelogs are retained unchanged.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 74f982c: Weekly dependency refresh (minor/patch within declared ranges) across the workspace. `@agentproto/runtime` moves to defuddle 0.19, which lifts a title-like `<h1>` into `title` instead of leading `text`, affecting `fetch_page`/`browser_extract_text` output.
