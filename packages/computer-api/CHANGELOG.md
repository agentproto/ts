# @agentproto/computer-api

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b350d5: New package `@agentproto/computer-api`: the versioned public contract for the computer controller HTTP API (zod schemas and inferred types for create/get/exec/suspend/resume/rm, the error envelope, computer states and published ports, plus a `COMPUTER_API_VERSION` constant), with contract fixtures per endpoint. `@agentproto/sandbox-computer` now imports its schemas from that package instead of carrying local copies and validates every controller response (and create/exec request bodies) against them, so shape drift fails loudly; its test fake controller validates everything it emits the same way.
